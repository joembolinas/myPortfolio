# 📁 Project Management Files

This directory contains project management and workflow automation files that help maintain consistency and professionalism throughout development.

## 📋 Files in This Directory

### `workflow-config.json`
- **Purpose:** Master configuration for standardized phase development workflow
- **Contains:** 8-step workflow process, quality gates, professional standards
- **Usage:** Referenced automatically by GitHub Copilot for all phase work

### `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`
- **Purpose:** User manual for the workflow system
- **Contains:** How-to guide, examples, pro tips, success metrics
- **Usage:** Reference when starting any new phase or task

## 🎯 Why This Directory Structure?

### **Not in `.vscode/`** because:
- `.vscode/` is for VS Code editor settings only
- These files are project management, not editor configuration
- Need to be version controlled and shared with team members

### **Not in root directory** because:
- Keeps project root clean and focused
- Groups related management files together
- Hidden directory (starts with `.`) keeps it organized but accessible

### **Perfect for `.project/`** because:
- ✅ Dedicated space for project management files
- ✅ Hidden but easily discoverable
- ✅ Version controlled with the project
- ✅ Logical grouping of workflow and process files
- ✅ Expandable for future project management needs

## 🔍 How to Find These Files

### **In VS Code:**
- Files are visible in Explorer panel under `.project/` folder
- Use `Ctrl+P` → type `workflow` to quick-open files
- Search across workspace will find content in these files

### **In Terminal:**
```bash
# View workflow config
cat .project/workflow-config.json

# Open workflow guide
code .project/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md

# List all project management files
ls .project/
```

### **Future Additions:**
This directory can expand to include:
- Phase templates
- Quality checklists
- Performance benchmarks
- Testing templates
- Deployment scripts

**This structure ensures workflow files are organized, discoverable, and maintainable as your project grows!** 🚀
