## Overview

Returned to formal education to build strong theoretical foundations in computer science while applying real-world experience to academic learning. Balancing intensive coursework with practical programming projects and personal skill development. This structured learning complements self-directed learning through LeetCode and online resources.

## Key Learnings

- Data structures and algorithms fundamentals
- Object-oriented programming principles and design patterns
- Database design and SQL management
- Software engineering methodologies and best practices
- Mathematical foundations for computing
- Code documentation and collaboration standards
- Debugging and problem-solving techniques

## Technologies

- Java for OOP and data structures
- Python for algorithmic problem-solving
- SQL for database management
- Git/GitHub for version control
- Academic tools (UML, ER diagrams)

## Achievements

- Maintaining high academic performance while learning
- Successfully balancing work experience with new concepts
- Active participation in programming assignments
- Building portfolio projects alongside coursework
- Applying real-world admin experience to software engineering concepts
- Collaborating effectively on group programming projects

## Challenges

- Adapting to formal academic structure after work experience
- Balancing intensive learning with practical application
- Keeping up with rapidly evolving technology landscape
- Managing time between classes, labs, and personal projects
- Refreshing math fundamentals alongside programming

## Academic Reflection Essay

The transition back to school was challenging but rewarding. Learning theory alongside practical skills has given me a more complete perspective on software development. The rigor of academic coursework ensures I understand not just the "how" but the "why" behind programming concepts.
