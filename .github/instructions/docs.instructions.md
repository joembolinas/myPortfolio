# Documentation Integrity Guidelines

When reviewing or working with documentation in this repository:

## Entity Consistency Checks

- Verify that entity names (classes, functions, variables, APIs, metadata, constant, item description, feature id, section) are spelled, align each consistently across all docs
- Cross-reference technical terms between README, API docs, and code comments
- Flag any discrepancies in naming conventions or terminology

## Documentation Alignment Rules

- All referenced files must exist in the repository
- Code examples in docs must match actual implementation
- Version numbers and dependencies must be consistent across all documentation files
- API endpoints documented must match the actual codebase

## Integrity Validation

- Check that all cross-references between documents are valid
- Verify that documented features exist in the codebase
- Ensure consistent formatting and structure across documentation files
