## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Status checks not appearing:**
1. Ensure GitHub Actions workflows have run at least once
2. Check that workflow names match exactly
3. Verify workflows are enabled in repository settings

**Cannot merge despite approvals:**
1. Check that all required status checks are passing
2. Verify branch is up to date with target branch
3. Ensure no conversation threads are unresolved

**Administrators cannot push:**
1. Check "Include administrators" setting
2. Verify you have admin permissions on the repository

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once branch protection is configured:
1. Test the workflow with a sample feature branch
2. Configure repository topics/tags
3. Set up GitHub Projects board
