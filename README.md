## What it's about

So, this is basically my personal portfolio project that I'm building as I learn React. It's like a sandbox for experimenting with modern web tools – React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, and trying to make things performant and accessible. Think of it as a bunch of UI experiments, some demo components, and a way to show off my journey to tech.

**Heads up:** This thing is super unstable. I'm constantly tinkering, so features, code, and APIs might flip around a lot. Use it for inspiration or learning, but don't rely on it for anything serious. You've been warned!

Learning vibes: I'm teaching myself React here, so expect some rough edges, half-baked ideas, and a ton of refactors as I go. It's all part of the fun.

## Cool bits

- Little demo projects and components to test out React + Vite tricks.
- Focusing on making it fast, accessible, and easy for devs to work with.
- Using virtual content and markdown for quick changes and iterations.

## Getting started

Wanna run this locally? Cool, it's pretty straightforward.
