# Archive Index

This document tracks materials moved to `legacy/` during project reorganization.

## Archive Structure

### legacy/others/
**Source:** Root `others/` directory  
**Contains:** Phase 1 planning documents, drafts, and reference materials

#### Phase-1/ Directory
- Planning documents and step-by-step guides
- Technical documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Command references and setup instructions
- Old README versions and file indexes
- Chat logs and development notes

#### Phase-2/ Directory
- Early Phase 2 planning documents
- UI wireframe files (ui-2.html)
- Phase 2 development notes

### legacy/css/ & legacy/js/
**Source:** Root static asset directories  
**Contains:** Original HTML/CSS/JS portfolio implementation

These files represent the static site version before React migration. They're preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Code comparison
- Potential future needs
- Complete project timeline documentation

## Why Archived

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Primary workspace now focuses on active development
2. **Clear Separation:** Active docs vs. historical/reference materials
3. **Maintained History:** Nothing deleted - everything preserved for learning
4. **Better Organization:** Logical grouping by purpose and timeline

## Current Active Documentation

Located in `docs/`:
- PROJECT_CHARTER.md - Project vision and goals
- MASTER_OUTLINE.md - 5-phase development plan
- PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md - Phase 1 achievements
- PHASE2_BACKLOG.md - Current development tasks
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Development standards
